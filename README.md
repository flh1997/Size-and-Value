# Size-and-Value
Prepare data for analysis. Combine necessary CRSP and Compustat datasets needed to define size and book-to-market decile portfolios as dened in Fama and French (1992b)1, as well as the HML and SMB factors as defined in Fama and French (1993)2. Detail which datasets you use, how you merged them, how you calculated the portfolios, and any differences between the building of the decile portfolios and the factors. Output should be between January 1973 and December 2019.
